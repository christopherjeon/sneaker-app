# Sneaker "Wish List" App

This full-stack web application allows sneakerheads to keep track of shoes that they'd like purchase in the future. A RESTful API was created in order to handle creating, updating, and deleting instances of the sneaker schema. The `react-table` library was used to display the list as well as offering sorting and filtering capabilities.
